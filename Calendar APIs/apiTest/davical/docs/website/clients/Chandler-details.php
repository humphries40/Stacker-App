<h1>Chandler</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/">Open Source Applications Foundation</a> are developing <a href="http://cosmo.osafoundation.org/">Cosmo</a>, which is a CalDAV server
written in Java and <a href="http://chandler.osafoundation.org/">Chandler</a>, which is a CalDAV capable mail and calendaring application
written in Python.</p>

<p>Basic setup is as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select "Subscribe" from the "Share" menu (or in older builds it was in the "Collection" menu).</li>
<li>Enter a URL like: "http://calendar.example.net/caldav.php/username/calendar/" (click "Subscribe") <img src="clients/Chandler-dialog1.png" /> <br /> &nbsp;</li>
<li>You will then be prompted for a username/password with in an expanded dialog.  Enter these and click "Subscribe" again. <img src="clients/Chandler-dialog2.png" /> <br /> &nbsp;</li>
<li>You should now have a new calendar showing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Caveats</h2>
<p>Chandler describes itself as 'an experimentally usable calendar', and it certainly feels that
way.  It also will only synchronise to the CalDAV server either when you press the "Sync"
button or with a default frequency of quarter-hourly.  This is quite different to the other clients I
have used which all aggressively push new and changed items to the server as soon as possible,
but which may be lazy about fetching updates.</p>

<p>Operation with DAViCal seems generally fine although Chandler does not correctly display the account
information correctly, even if it seems to remember it internally.</p>
