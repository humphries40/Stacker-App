Initial DAViCal configuration on Debian
=======================================

General installation and configuration information is available at
http://www.davical.org/installation.php Please visit that website for
details and further reading.

After installation, basic configuration with a local database consists
of the following steps:

1. Allow DAViCal to connect to the database, by adding the following 2
lines at the top of your pg_hba.conf file (path depending on postgres
version, for Debian Jessie try /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/pg_hba.conf):

    local   davical    davical_app   trust
    local   davical    davical_dba   trust

2. Create the database, noting the displayed DAViCal admin password:

    sudo -u postgres /usr/share/davical/dba/create-database.sh

3. Create an Apache vhost config, or symlink /usr/share/davical/htdocs
somewhere below an existing vhost's document root

4. Create /etc/davical/config.php containing at least the lines

    <?php
      $c->pg_connect[] = 'dbname=davical user=davical_app';
    ?>

5. Point your browser to /setup.php (or wherever you symlinked the
htdocs directory in step 3), log in as user admin with the password
noted in step 2 above, and review the displayed issues, if any. 

After that you're all set to create and configure users, upload existing
calendars or set up clients.
