DAViCal CalDAV Server by Andrew McMillan.

For documentation you are best advised to visit the sourceforge pages
or to start searching from http://davical.org/ and see where you end
up.

There's lots of useful information at http://wiki.davical.org/ as well,
and if you want access to update that contact us on IRC or send an e-mail
to <wiki-access@davical.org>.

Good luck!
