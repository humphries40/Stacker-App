# Here we are binding against a collection which is itself a binding
# bindings, at the same level in the same collection.
#
# Before:
#  /user4/boundbase a binding to a collection containing two bindings
#                   and a real collection
#
# After:
#  /user4/bind2bind is bound to /user4/boundbase, so it should also
#                 appear to contain two bindings and a collection
